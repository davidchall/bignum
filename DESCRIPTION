Description: Classes for storing and manipulating arbitrary-precision
    integer vectors and high-precision floating-point vectors. These
    extend the range and precision of the 'integer' and 'double' data
    types found in R. This package utilizes the 'Boost.Multiprecision' C++
    library. It is specifically designed to work well with the 'tidyverse'
    collection of R packages.
