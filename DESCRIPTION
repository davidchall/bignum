Description: S3 classes for storing and manipulating
    arbitrary-precision integer and floating-point vectors, utilizing the
    'Boost.Multiprecision' C++ library.  These extend the range and
    precision of the fixed-precision 'integer' and 'double' types.  It is
    specifically designed to work well with the 'tidyverse' collection of
    R packages.
