Description: S3 classes for storing and manipulating arbitrary-precision
    integer vectors and high-precision floating-point vectors. These
    extend the range and precision of the fixed-precision 'integer' and
    'double' data types found in R. This package utilizes the
    'Boost.Multiprecision' C++ library. It is specifically designed to
    work well with the 'tidyverse' collection of R packages.
